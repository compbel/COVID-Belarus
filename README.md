# COVID-Belarus
Since the emergence of the COVID-19 the series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) has been implemented by governments and public health authorities around the globe in order to control and curb the ongoing pandemic spread. From that perspective, Belarus represents a unique example of a country with a relatively modern healthcare system, which officials have still chosen to implement a highly limited amount of NPIs to fight the pandemics. Until recently, very little has been known about the COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics in Belarus due to the scarcity of available data. In this work, the combination of surveillance and genomic epidemiology methods has been used to analyze the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Belarus.
